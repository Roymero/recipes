        <h3>"Somos pas peruanos que la papa"</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        Papa a la Huancaina is one of the most peruvian dishes right next to the Ceviche.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dish was originally served at the railway stations between Lima and Huancayo,
    </p>
    <p>
        sold to passengers as a light food consisting of potatoes bathed in a delicious cheese and pepper sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
        From that came the name “potatoes that you eat in route to Hauncayo” which would later be changed to 
        Papa a la Huancaina.
